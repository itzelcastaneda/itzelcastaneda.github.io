# About

I’m a Master of Computer Science student at Rice University, studying how people and algorithms shape each other through data, design, and ethics.

My work sits at the intersection of computational methods and social inquiry — I build experiments, analyze data, and write about the human consequences of technical choices.

- ✨ Research interests: Computational social science, HCI, AI ethics, digital communities.
- 🎓 Education: MCS — Rice University.
